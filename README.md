# a8 - Project

This repository contains a Python programming project, created as part of an assignment for the _Introduction to Programming for Information and Data Science_ course at the UW iSchool.

This final project pulls data from the Marvel Comics API (https://developer.marvel.com/). The primary focus of this project is 
to pull data from the API, manipulate the data using the Pandas library, and to create visualizations through the Bokeh library.
This primary section will be conducted within the Jupyter Notebook titled 'a8-DataAnalysis'. 

The secondary part of the analysis will allow the user to run a script from their terminal. The script will ask the user to provide a 
Marvel character that they are interested in and will provide applicable information regarding the character.
